# The task
- In August 2021, the company carried out an SEO marketing campaign on blog posts and courses on the website.
- The marketing team wanted to know how to improve the user experience on the website and provide more relevant content to each customer segment through this campaign analysis.
# Cleaning data
- Email column: If the email contains ‘outlook’, it means the user is working, if it contains ‘ueh, uef, ctu .’, it means the user is a student. For example hoanghiep@ueh.com => separate ‘ueh’ into ‘HCM University of Economics’ for the University column and classify this email as ‘student’ for the Customer type column.
- Name Column: For example, if the article title has the keyword ‘Data, data, excel...’ it will be classified into the Data topic for the Name Category column.
- MA Referrer column: For example, the data ‘facebook.com’ or ‘https://www.facebook.com’ will be classified as ‘facebook’ in the Referral column.
- The Datetime column is divided into Access Date in the Dates column and Access Time in the Hour column.
# Some insights found
- Google is the most effective platform in SEO marketing campaigns with Skills and Data being the two topics that most users are interested in. In particular, articles related to Excel and data analysis have the most visits.
- Ad content is outdated after the first 2 weeks, leading to a decrease in purchases.
- Users usually access the time frames 9-10am, 12pm, 3pm and 9-10pm. These are the breaks and rest times for users => These are the ideal times to focus advertising budget.
- Economics students tend to be more interested in data topics than students in other majors. They have a lot of access to the Young Talent program in the Skills topic => Maybe they are learning and improving their skills to meet the labor market after graduation.
